\section{Game Rules}
\label{sec:rules}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The game, called \emph{\gamename}, is played in the arena defined in
        \specref{spec:arena}. The objective is to collect tokens, and to bring
        them to one's scoring zone in addition to removing opponents tokens from
        your zone.
  \item The arena contains 16 tokens. The layout is detailed in
        \specref{spec:arena}.
  \item At the end of the game, tokens within the scoring zone of a robot (see
        \ruleref{rules:token}) score as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item 3 points for each token matching the colour of the zone
      \item -1 point for each token not matching the colour of the scoring zone
    \end{enumerate}
        For example: if the red zone contains a red token and a blue token, then
        that zone would score 2 points ($+3$ for the red token, but $-1$ for the
        blue token).
  \item An additional 1 bonus point is awarded if a robot moves out of its
        starting zone.
  \item \label{rules:token}A token is in a scoring zone if, and only if, it
        has three corners in contact with the floor in the zone.
  \item Participating teams must present their robots to match officials at
        least one minute before the start of each match.
  \item There will be up to 4 robots in each match.
  \item \org may have any number of match officials within the arena, including
        during the course of matches.
  \item At the start of each match, robots must be entirely within their
        starting zones.
  \item At the start of each match, teams will be permitted to lean into the
        arena and start their robots.
  \item Each match lasts $120$ seconds.
  \item During matches teams must not touch or interfere with any part of the
        inside of the arena (including robots and tokens), except to start their
        robot under the direction of match officials.
  \item Teams may be disqualified from one or all matches by match officials,
        for non-compliance with regulations, lateness to the match, or any other
        reason at the discretion of the judge. Teams disqualified before the
        start time of a match will not be permitted to enter a robot.
\end{enumerate}
